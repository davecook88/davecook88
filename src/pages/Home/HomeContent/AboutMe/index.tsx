            <p className="text-primary-100 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              I am a British software engineer and language enthusiast living and
              working remotely from central Mexico.
            </p>
            <p className="text-primary-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              My formal education is in foreign languages and language teaching. As
              I was working in schools and universities in the UK, Japan, Vietnam,
              Colombia, and Mexico, I became frustrated with the repetitive and
              laborious administrative tasks that took away from the joy of teaching
              and learning. Thinking that there must be a better way lead me into
              the world of software development, first via VBA in Excel, then Google
              Apps Script, and beyond.
            </p>
            <p className="text-primary-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              I discovered a love for building software and an aptitude for problem
              solving which has driven my career ever since.
            </p>
            <p className="text-primary-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              During the pandemic, I found myself between jobs and stuck in a small
              apartment in Hanoi's strict lockdown. Making the most of unexpected
              circumstances, I began my career as a freelance developer, building
              API integrations for businesses all around the world.
            </p>
            <p className="text-primary-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Pretty soon, it became clear that the demand for my skills wouldn't
              leave me much time for teaching languages anymore.
            </p>
            <p className="text-primary-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              I consider myself extremely lucky to have been able to turn what
              started off as a few fun projects into a long and successful career in
              software development.

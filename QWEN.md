This is a personal portfolio website for Dave Cook, a skilled and gifted full stack web developer.

Use tailwind classes as much as possible for consistency. Only create custom classes when absolutely necessary.

You will assume that the user has the dev server running. You will not run the server. You will ask the user if the changes are correct.

This portfolio page has an innovative menu/structure. There is a JSON object which can be manipulated. Depending on what parts of the JSON are open, the contents of the "main view" window will update. For instance, if the "About Me" and "Projects" are open, then the main view will display these 2 sections in order.

On mobile, the JSON should be at the top of the screen. This will need to be minimizable to allow the user to see more of the content.

On desktop, the JSON will be on the left and the main content will be on the right.

If nothing is selected, the main view should display some text prompting the user to interact with the JSON.
